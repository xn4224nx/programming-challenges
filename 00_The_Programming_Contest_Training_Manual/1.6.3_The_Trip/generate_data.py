GENERATE CHALLENGE SAMPLES
==========================

Generate text in files that simulates valid inputs to the contest. The script 
will also create the valid answers to the challenge.

Each trip starts with a single line indicating the number of students, this is 
then followed by the amount paid by each student as a two decimal point number.
The file will end with a zero.
